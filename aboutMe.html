          My name is Marucs Baumgardner. Though I may not have much formal education
          my entire life has been dedicated to learning. I've spent my life teaching myself
          on topics that interest me in my spare time. 
          <br><br>
          When I was 12 years old I started to teach myself how to play guitar, which sparked a passion for
          music I have have continued to develop. At the age of 25 I started teaching myself how to play drums,
          which was a goal of mine since I was a young child banging on pots and pans in my mother's kitchen.
          <br><br>
          My studies in music has lead me to develop not only a dedication to understanding concepts, but a drive to 
          implement them with percision. These are skills that I strive to apply to every subject that I study.
