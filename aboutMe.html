          My name is Marucs Baumgardner. Though I may not have much formal education
          my entire life has been dedicated to learning. I've spent my life teaching myself
          on topics that interest me in my spare time. 
          <br><br>
          When I was 12 years old I started to teach myself how to play guitar, which sparked a passion for
          music I have have continued to develop. At the age of 25 I started teaching myself how to play drums,
          which was a goal of mine since I was a young child banging on pots and pans in my mother's kitchen.
          <br><br>
          My studies in music have lead me to develop not only a dedication to understanding complex concepts (such as polyrhythms, odd time signatures, music theory), but a drive to 
          implement them with percision. I've learned that it's important to not only understand theory, but to be able to exercise theory through praxis.
          These are skills that I strive to apply to every subject that I study.
          <br><br>
          Recently I've resumed my study of computer programming and have used these techniques to gain an insightful knowledge of programming. 
          Though I still have much to learn, I plan to use this methodology every step of the way to guide me on my way of mastering the craft.
